# Investigating valence and sentiment in music
This research would like to address the question: What is the Relationship Between Valence, Sentiment in Song Names and Music Genre? 

The composite visualisation provides understanding of the relationship between valence and sentiment in music genres. While the scatter plot highlights broad emotional trends, the wordcloud uncovers linguistic patterns in sentiment analysis, and the heatmap and PCA plot contextualise these patterns within audio features.
